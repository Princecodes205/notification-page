## My process

My process was quite simple,
I realy had tough times structring the html section of this challenge but finally made it ðŸ¤—.
Then added the styles using flexbox and also the mobile and desktop versions.

finally js helped with the javascript to mark all new notifications as seen.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Notin new though, just enjoyed the process ðŸ˜Ž
